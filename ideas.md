# ideas

- [ ] Parallel tree traversal for OnScore (probably requires wildly unsafe stuff)
- [ ] OnScorePostProcess for Evaluated/Evaluators so that you don't need an additional score entity just to curve scores
- [ ] post order DFS for nested pickers?
- [ ] benchmarks (10000 actors)
- [ ] cache the entire children tree hierarchy on the root entity
- [ ] chained and concurrent actions
- [ ] utility AI builder in editor
